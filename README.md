Link to where our app is hosted: http://ec2-54-160-8-114.compute-1.amazonaws.com/displayRecord.php (to view all the pictures and their different "phlares" that have been uploaded to the server)

http://ec2-54-160-8-114.compute-1.amazonaws.com/imageInformation.php (for analytics information about the pictures)

To test our system, you will need to download our android application onto your android device and run it. You will then need to upload a picture to our database using the camera application. After that, you can check the displayrecord.php page to see if your image has successfully been uploaded to the server.
